Canned Food Transition for Cats Addicted to Dry Food
There are few things in life more frustrating than dealing with a finicky cat. Cats can be incredibly 'set in their ways' when it comes to their dietary preferences. Cats, like children, often resist what is best for them. The transition process often involves much more than just plunking down a new food item. Time, patience, and tricks are often required.
Home Cooked or Raw Diets for Dogs and Cats
Cats' overall health can be significantly improved with a high-protein canned food diet to help maintain good hydration.

Inappropriate Elimination (House-Soiling) in Cats
Cats learn by association, so the sudden appearance of the carrier tends to signal that something scary is happening. Training cats to love their carriers is beneficial for many reasons. The key is to build and maintain a positive association with the carrier to make your cat’s visit to the veterinarian as low stress as possible.
